# quantar-breakout-pcb

This project is a breakout board for the Quantar repeater which takes the signals from the Telco 50-pin connector and breaks it out into:

- 3.5mm jacks for RX and TX audio
- DB-9 connector for repeater controller
- level-shifted I/O for status and control (great for Raspberry Pi)
- and more!


The goal is two flavors: one with a RJ21 connector and one with just an array of 50 pins (this can be used with an unterminated telco-50 cable)
